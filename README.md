# Jinja2-ExploitMe
An SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection) is enabled by unsafely embedded user input. We will go over 2 different ways these exploits can be made and how to secure our program from these vulnerabilities.

## Run the file
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. run command: `export FLASK_ENV=development; flask run`
## Exploit 1: Multiply two integers
http://127.0.0.1:5000/?exploit={{2*32}}
output : 
```
64
```

## Exploit 2: Multiply a string and an int
http://127.0.0.1:5000/?exploit={{"a"*20}}
```
Not a valid Jinja2 expression.
```

## Fix:
I removed `render_template_string`. It seemed uncessary to use to begin with because `render_template` gives the result we need already. `render_template_string` was allowing the input string to be evaluated. Instead, we now just print the string directly regardless of any symbols that might indicate it to be code. This removes possibility of expoits!
